\section{Experiments}
\subsection{Tier 1}
As discussed above we will duplicate the results presented in the paper 
on three simulated environments designed for simulated reaching, 
pushing, and placing. Recreating these results will be the first
step in this project and will ensure that we are comfortable with 
the algorithm and are certain it is working correctly. 

\subsection{Tier 2}
Once we have the vanilla MIL algorithm working we will extend the network
architecture to utilize an external memory. Our plan is to develop one
architecture that uses the memory put forward in "Learning to Remember Rare Events"
and another that uses the memory unit described in 
"Matching Networks for One Shot Learning".

\subsection{Evaluation}
We will evaluate the success of our models by plotting the task success rate
vs. the number of examples in the training set for both 1-shot and 5-shot validation
sets. Here "shot" refers to the number of samples that the Meta model 
uses for fine-tuning to a held out validation task.
