\section{Milestones}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Set up the three simulated environments 
    \item Get MIL running on one of the three environemtns
    \item Create script to evalute success and plot performance
    \item Train and evalute model on all environements
    \item Download reference implementations of "Learning to Remember Rare Events" 
          (LRRE) and "Matching Networks for One Shot Learning" (Matching Networks)
    \item Reproduce LRRE results on Omniglot
    \item Reproduce Matching Networks Results on Omniglot
    \item Attach LRRE memory module to MIL network architecture 
    \item Attach Matching Networks memory module to MIL network architecture
    \item Evaluate results both memory networks on all three environments
\end{enumerate}
