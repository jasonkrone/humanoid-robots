\begin{abstract}
This project builds on the work done in "One-Shot Visual Imitation Learning via Meta-Learning"
by Chelsea Finn et al. 2017. We aim to both duplicate the results presented in the paper
for simulated environements as well as improve the neural network architecture proposed
by Finn et al. through the addition of a memory component. We evaluate of our model architecture
on the same simulated robotic environments used by Finn et al. to allow for direct comparison
between the two models.
